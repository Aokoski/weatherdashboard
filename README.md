weather dashboard using openweather api
As a person who often travels by foot, I would like a weather dashboard to show the current weather, and a 5 day forecast for a given city.
So far, the app is capable of performing a search, displaying the current forecast for that city, and rendering a button showing the city search history. Currently working on storing that info in local storage, and need to figure out how to add/style the 5 day forecast. 
Going to just submit what I have now and will resubmit later with the 5 day forecast. I apologize for the sloppiness of the appearance, but at least it sort of works.
