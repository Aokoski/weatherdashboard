weather dashboard using openweather api
As a person who often travels by foot, I would like a weather dashboard to show the current weather, and a 5 day forecast for a given city.
So far, the app is capable of performing a search, displaying the current forecast for that city, and rendering a button showing the city search history. Currently working on storing that info in local storage, and need to figure out how to add/style the 5 day forecast. 
Going to just submit what I have now and will resubmit later with the 5 day forecast. I apologize for the sloppiness of the appearance, but at least it sort of works.

Revisited with my Tutor. Saved city to localstorage but couldn't figure out how to save every entry. Everytime there was a new city entry it would replace the previous one instead of appending to it. We also created the 5 day forecast function.
